Any information you provide to us that is not required is voluntary.<br /> <br /> You are free to choose whether to provide us with the types of Personal Data requested, but we may not be able to serve you as effectively or offer you all of our Services when you do choose not to share certain information with us. However, we shall strive to provide you with the best possible Services always.<br /> We also collect Personal Data when you use or request information about our Services, subscribe to marketing communications, request support, complete surveys, or sign up for one of our events.<br /> We may also collect Personal Data from you offline, such as when you attend one of our events, or when you contact customer support.<br /> We may use this information in combination with other information we collect about you as set forth in this Privacy Policy.<br /> </li>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>To Maintain Legal and Regulatory Compliance</strong><br /> Some of our Services are subject to laws and regulations requiring us to collect and use your personal identification information, formal identification information, financial information, transaction information, employment information, online identifiers, and/or usage data in certain ways.<br /> We must identify and verify customers using our Services in order to comply with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws across jurisdictions or as may be more specifically required by the UAE&rsquo;s Anti-Money Laundering Regulations.

                        <li><strong>To Enforce Our Terms in Our User Agreement and Other Agreements</strong><br /> We handle sensitive information, such as your identification and financial data, so it is very important for us and our customers that we are actively monitoring, investigating, preventing, and mitigating any potentially prohibited or illegal activities, enforcing our agreements with third parties, and/or violations of our posted user agreement or agreement for other Services. In addition, we may need to collect fees based on your use of our Services. We collect information about your account usage and closely monitor your interactions with our Services. We may use any of your personal information collected on our Services for these purposes. The consequence of not processing your personal information for such purposes is the termination of your account as we cannot provide our Services in accordance with our terms.<br /> </li>
                        <li><strong>To Provide ICONX Services<br /> </strong>We may receive and share your data with our partners and service providers when it is necessary and relevant to the services you have requested.

                        <li><strong>To Provide Customer Service</strong><br /> We process your personal information when you contact us to resolve any question, dispute, collected fees, or to troubleshoot problems.

                        <li><strong>To Ensure Quality Control</strong><br /> We process your personal information for quality control and staff training to make sure we continue to provide you with accurate information.

                        <li><strong>For Research and Development Purposes</strong><br /> We process your personal information to better understand the way you use and interact with our Services. In addition, we use such information to customize, measure, and improve the Services and the content and layout of our website and applications, and to develop new services. Without such processing, we cannot ensure your continued enjoyment of our Services. Our basis for such processing is based on legitimate interest. You may inform us about the same in the event you do not wish to avail such<br /> </li>
                        <li><strong>To Enhance Your Website Experience</strong><br /> We process your personal information to provide a personalized experience and implement the preferences you request.

                        <li><strong>To Engage in Marketing Activities</strong><br /> Based on your communication preferences, we may send you marketing communications to inform you about our events or our partner events; to deliver targeted marketing, and to provide you with promotional offers based on your communication preferences. We use information about your usage of our Services and your contact information to provide marketing communications. You can opt out of our marketing communications at any time.<br /> If you are a current customer residing in the EEA, we will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) with information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you.<br /> If you are a new customer and located in the EEA, we will contact you if you are located in the EU by electronic means for marketing purposes only if you have consented to such communication. If you do not want us to use your personal information in this way, or to pass your personal information on to third parties for marketing purposes, please follow the opt-out links included in marketing communications or contact us at <a href="mailto:support@iconx.work">support@iconx.network</a>.

                        <li>The Promoter is obliged to provide only accurate statements regarding ICONX and its Products and Services. Such statements must align with the official communications of ICONX and its Communication Material. <br /> <br /> </li>
                        <li>When promoting Products and Services offered by ICONX, the Promoter is responsible for making all information in the official Communication Material clearly available.

                        <li>The Promoter is obligated to utilize the official information provided in the Communication Materials. Any dissemination of incomplete or inaccurate or change of information regarding any Product and/or Service offered by ICONX renders the Promoter liable. The unauthorized use of promotional material grants ICONX the right, without any liability, to immediately terminate the Agreement without prior notice.<br /> </li>
                        <li>The Promoter is strictly prohibited from making income-related statements or claims about their earnings potential at ICONX. Instead, the Promoter is obliged to explicitly caution potential promoters during initiation discussions that achieving a high income through this program is attainable by only a minority of promoters.<br /> </li>
                        <li>Sales and marketing endeavors must not replicate commissions, construed as "refer-to-earn bounties" or other commissions tied solely to the recruitment of new Promoters. No actions should create the impression that the promoted distribution system is unlawful, such as an illegal progressive Ponzi scheme, pyramid scheme, or any fraudulent scheme. Similarly, it must not be misrepresented that ICONX engages in the distribution of currency investments, financial investments, or the sale or distribution of digital assets or other digital assets through itself or third parties. It is expressly clarified that ICONX does not directly or indirectly sell, distribute, or broker any digital assets through itself or third parties.<br /> </li>
                        <li>Sales and marketing activities must not target minors or inexperienced individuals and shall not exploit their age, health status, or limited capacity to understand and induce them to enter into contracts. When interacting with socially vulnerable or non-native language groups, Promoters must consider their financial capability and language comprehension and their understanding of the services and products offered. The Promoter bears full responsibility towards third parties for any violations thereof. Otherwise, ICONX reserves the right to terminate such contracts without liability to the Promoter or third parties. Measures must be taken to prevent members of such groups from placing orders that are not suitable for their circumstances.<br /> </li>
                        <li>Sales and marketing activities must refrain from being overpromising, inappropriate, illegal, unsafe, or exerting undue pressure on targeted consumers.

                        <li>Promoters may only utilize testimonials or personal references for business purposes if officially authorized by both the referrer and ICONX, and if accurate and up to date. Testimonials and personal references must always be relevant to the intended purpose.<br /> </li>
                        <li>Customers shall not be persuaded to accept services through dubious or misleading promises, or promises of special benefits linked to uncertain future success. Promoters must abstain from inducing customers to accept offers solely to accommodate the provider, end an unwanted conversation, obtain an advantage unrelated to the offer, or express gratitude for such an advantage.<br /> <br /> </li>

                    <p>The Platform allows its Users, who agree to the Terms, to buy products and services from its Seller Platform, which are made available and operated by third parties (hereinafter referred to as the "Seller Platforms").</p>
                    <p>The purpose of this Platform is to offer an opportunity for Users to promote third-party products and services and earn benefits. When a User places an order from a Seller Platform, they agree to their policies, terms, and conditions and also agree that their information will be shared between ICONX and the Seller Platform to perform the services. ICONX only acts as a marketing provider of that Seller Platform and does not guarantee the return of any product and service provided.</p>
                    <p>ICONX shall not be liable or responsible for any products and services offered by Seller Platforms that do not meet the expectations of Users in any manner. Users are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of the service provided therein. All products and services offered on ICONX platform are subject to a User&rsquo;s acceptance of the Seller platform policies, terms, and conditions.</p>
                    <h2>ICONX Account</h2>
                    <p>A User can register on the Platform and choose a &lsquo;username&rsquo; and a &lsquo;password,&rsquo; both determined by the User themselves. The &lsquo;username&rsquo; is unique, so that no two Users will ever share the same &lsquo;username.&rsquo; In case the &lsquo;username&rsquo; selected has already been assigned to another User, it is advised to use a variant of the same, or another &lsquo;username&rsquo; altogether. The &lsquo;password&rsquo; is confidential and known only to the User, who can change it whenever desired. Selecting and safeguarding the password is the User's sole responsibility, and ICONX is not responsible for any issues arising from its use.</p>
                    <p>ICONX notifies Users about promotions that offer potential benefits in the ICONX Backoffice through email. Account details, including the &lsquo;username&rsquo;, registered email, registered phone number etc., may be received or shared with third-party companies for service provision. To access services requiring an additional Seller Platform account, users must undergo a registration process on the Seller Platform.</p>
                    <p>By using the Platform, Users affirm that the personal information provided is accurate and current, undertaking to promptly update any changes. Impersonation or the use of false names is prohibited. Registering multiple accounts under a single User is not allowed, and violating this may lead to account termination. Users must keep their passwords and/or secret phrases confidential, not sharing them with anyone. Users acknowledge and agree that secret phrases are not recoverable and losing them will stop the access to their account. They are responsible for all activities and orders under their account. If they suspect any unauthorized access, Users should promptly contact ICONX.</p>
                    <p>The Platform should not be used for unlawful or unauthorized purposes, including distributing objectionable material, interfering with others' use of the Platform, or attempting unauthorized access through hacking, phishing, or any other fraudulent means.</p>
                    <p>Each User is expected to hold only one account, with service allowed in certain cases, but promotions may not be applicable. To delete an account, Users must contact ICONX via email or our chat feature, and formally submit a deletion request.</p>
                    <h2>Subscription Order Submission</h2>
                    <p>After a User reviews a product or service and elects to subscribe and complete an order on ICONX or a Seller Platform, they will need to finalize the subscription and place the order by clicking the &lsquo;Checkout&rsquo; button. It is crucial that the User reviews the information they enter and correct anything amiss before clicking the &lsquo;Checkout&rsquo; button, because once the order is placed, no errors can be rectified. Upon receiving the order, both ICONX and the Seller Platform will process the subscription and will notify the User via email once their order has been successfully placed.</p>
                    <p>If any payment a User makes is not authorized, they will be redirected to the previous page on the Platform. ICONX is not obligated to complete the order and provide the subscription service. The User is not entitled to cancel a subscription order or receive a refund unless the cancellation is a result of ICONX or the Seller Platform's system default. Any credit or debit cards, electronic wallets, and/or bank account used in placing orders on the Platform must belong to the user.</p>
                    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Prices And Payment</h2>
                    <p>Upon acceptance of their order, an agreement is established between a User and the Seller Platform. ICONX does not provide any payment services to Users or third parties.

                            <ul>
                                <li>ICONX does not advise on the merits of any product and service, mining and trading risks, or tax consequences, and ICONX does not provide any other financial, investment, taxation or legal advice in connection with the Services. To the extent that we or our representatives provide market commentary, or any other information, the act of doing so is incidental to a User&rsquo;s relationship with us and such information should not be construed as investment or financial advice.

The User must represent that they are not relying on any communication (written or oral) by us as investment advice or as a recommendation to use the Services. ICONX will not be liable for any loss suffered by a User or any third party.</li>
                                <li>Users accept the risk of using the platform service.

                            <strong>Risks of Digital Asset Services</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Digital assets are highly volatile and carry a high degree of risk, subject to rapid and unexpected price fluctuations. The price of digital assets may move up or down and may become valueless.</li>
                                <li>Digital assets are not legal tender. They may not be backed by physical assets and are not guaranteed by a government. They may not have intrinsic value.</li>
                                <li>Transactions involving digital assets are irrevocable. Lost or stolen digital assets may be irretrievable. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded on a blockchain, loss or stolen digital assets generally will not be reversible.</li>
                                <li>Digital asset services including but not limited to mining and trading may incur losses rather than profit. Digital assets, being a high-risk asset class invites utmost caution while dealing or trading with them.<br /> </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Digital Assets: Liquidity, Volatility &amp; Transfers</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Digital asset services can be extremely risky and volatile. They may have unique features that make them more or less likely to fluctuate in value.</li>
                                <li>Factors beyond ICONX&rsquo;s or Seller Platform&rsquo;s control, such as regulatory activity or unexplainable price volatility, may affect market liquidity for a particular digital asset. Blockchain networks may go offline as a result of bugs, forks or other unforeseeable reasons. Any digital asset may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to various factors including discovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, change to the nature or properties of the digital asset, governmental or regulatory activity, legislative changes, suspension or cessation of support for a digital asset or other platforms or service providers, public opinion, or other factors outside of our control. Technical advancements, as well as broader economic and political factors, may cause the value of any digital asset to change significantly over a short period of time.</li>
                                <li>Understanding digital assets requires advanced technical knowledge. Digital assets are often described in exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer code to appreciate the inherent risks. We provide no warranty as to the suitability of digital assets for any products and services under these Terms and assume no fiduciary duty to any and all Users in connection with such use of the services.</li>
                                <li>Users accept all consequences of sending digital assets to an address off-the-platform. Digital asset transactions may not be reversible, which means that any accidental or fraudulent transactions in respect of digital assets may not be recoverable. Once a User sends any digital assets to an address, they accept the risk that theymay lose access to them indefinitely. For example, the network of the receiving wallet may be chosen incorrectly, or an address may have been entered incorrectly and the true owner of the address may never be discovered, or an address may belong to a person that will not return the digital assets.<br /> </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Complex Products</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Digital assets may be complex products by virtue that the terms, features and/or risk are not readily understood due to the complex structure, novelty and reliance on technological features.</li>
                                <li>Digital assets wallets, including those of ICONX and a Seller Platform, have certain limitations and restrictions in terms of the digital assets that they can support. Users will be informed of such limitations and under no circumstance should a User attempt to store digital assets in their wallet that it does not support. Doing so may result in irrevocable loss of the unsupported digital asset. When a User creates a wallet, the wallet software generates a cryptographic private and public key pair that they may use to send and receive any supported digital assets via the relevant network.<br /> Users are advised to store, outside of the products, a backup of all wallet credentials, including their passphrases, identifiers, backup phrases, private keys, and network addresses. If a User does not maintain a backup of their wallet data outside of the Products, they will not be able to access digital assets previously accessed using their wallet in the event that we discontinue or no longer offer some or all of the products. We do not have access to such data and are therefore NOT responsible for maintaining it on a User&rsquo;s behalf. We do not receive or store any wallet passwords, keys, or network addresses, and hence cannot assist any User with the password retrieval for their wallet.<br /> <br /> ICONX and the Seller Platform have no control over any digital asset network and therefore cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that a User submits using our products will be confirmed on the relevant digital asset network. The transaction details that a User submits using our products may not be completed or may be substantially delayed by the digital asset network used to process the transaction. We do not guarantee that the wallet can transfer the title or rights in any digital asset or make any warranties whatsoever with regard to the title. We shall not be responsible for any harm occurring as a result of the inability to reverse a transaction, and any losses in connection therewith due to erroneous or fraudulent actions.<br /> <br /> Since blockchain transactions are immutable, once transaction details have been submitted to a digital asset network, we cannot assist Users in cancelling or otherwise modifying their transaction or transaction details. We have no control over any digital asset network and do not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.<br /> </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Blacklisted Addresses and Forfeited Assets</strong><br /> ICONX and any of the affiliated Seller Platforms reserve the right to &lsquo;blacklist&rsquo; certain addresses and freeze associated assets (temporarily or permanently) that they determine, in its sole discretion, are associated with illegal activity or activity that otherwise violates the Terms ("Blacklisted Addresses"). If a User sends assets to a blacklisted address or receive assets from one, ICONX may freeze such assets and take steps to terminate their account.<br /> </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reliance on Distributed Ledger Technology</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Digital assets rely on various types of distributed ledger technology. Some of this technology is open-source software that is built upon experimental technology, namely blockchain. Risks arising from this reliance include the existence of technical flaws in the technology, targeting by malicious persons, majority-mining, consensus-based or other mining attacks, changes in the consensus protocol or algorithms, decreased community or miner support, rapid fluctuations in value of relevant digital assets, the existence or development of competing networks, platforms and assets, flaws in the scripting language, disputes between developers, miners and/or users and regulatory action.</li>
                                <li>
                                    The software protocols that underlie digital assets are typically open-source projects or are otherwise operated by third parties, which means that:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>(i) The operations, functionalities, development and control of such digital assets and their underlying networks are outside of ICONX&rsquo;s control; AND</li>
                                        <li>(ii) Such software protocols are subject to sudden and dramatic changes that might have a significant impact on the availability, usability or value of a given digital asset.<br /> </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
